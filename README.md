# Captcha

The provided CAPTCHA is a visual challenge designed to verify that a user is human and not a bot. It presents the user with a grid of randomized shapes, and the user must identify and click on a specific set of shapes within a time limit to pass the CAPTCHA.  

## Features  

- **Visual Elements:** The CAPTCHA consists of geometric shapes (pentagons, stars, and hearts) that are randomly placed on a colorful background.

- **Randomization:** The shapes' positions, sizes, and colors are randomized for each CAPTCHA generation, making it more challenging for automated bots to predict and interact with the challenge.

- **Time Limit:** Users have a limited amount of time (specified in seconds) to identify and click on the correct shapes. If they fail to do so within the time limit, they will not pass the CAPTCHA.

- **User Interaction:** Users must click on the correct shapes in a specific order to complete the CAPTCHA successfully.

- **Feedback:** The CAPTCHA provides feedback to the user by indicating whether they clicked on the correct shapes or not.
